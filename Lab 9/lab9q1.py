#Description: Write a Python program stored in a file q1.py which will ask the user to enter a filename, and
#open the file for reading. Write a program that reads the fileâ€™s contents and prints the total
#number of sentences in the file and calculates the average number of words per sentence. A
#file in the appropriate format (named sample.txt) can be downloaded from Canvas.
