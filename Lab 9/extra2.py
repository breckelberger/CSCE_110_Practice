#Description: Write a Python program stored in a file extra2.py. The program asks the user to input the
#dimension of a matrix ( rows and columns). Let the number of rows be ’r’ and the number of
#columns be ’c’. The program takes c space separated numbers as input for each row on r
#different lines. Once the matrix has been entered, you need to print the matrix in spiral order
#starting from the top left character. The values of r and c may not be the same
